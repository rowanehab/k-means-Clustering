# k-means-Clustering
•	Consider crime dataset in crime_data.csv file, it contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.
•	Write a program in any programming language you prefer to group the US states based on the similarity of their crimes. 
•	You should use k-means algorithm to cluster the states to k clusters 
•	Number of clusters (k) will be provided from the user as an input.
•	Initial centroid should be choosing randomly.
•	You should use Manhattan distance as your distance function.
•	You should detect outlier data (if exists).
•	The final output of your program should show k lists of states and show outlier product’s records.
